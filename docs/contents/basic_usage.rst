Basic Usage
***********

Starting the Application
------------------------
After completing setup and configuration, you can start the program by running **canvas_content_manager.pyw** from the project
directory. Creating a shortcut to this file, rather than running it from the project directory every time,
might be useful.

Token Login
-----------
You will need to obtain an access token for the user you wish to login with. See the `Canvas docs`_ for detailed
instructions. Enter the user token and click *Token Login*.

Selecting a Course
------------------
Selecting from Enrolled Courses
===============================
The course dropdown box displays courses that the user is enrolled in. Select a menu item to change the working course.
By default, the first course in the list will be selected.

Selecting by Course ID
======================
If you wish to select a course that the user is not enrolled in, but has permission to access, you can select a course
by its ID. You can then verify the selected course by the displayed course name.
